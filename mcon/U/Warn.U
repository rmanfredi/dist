?X: This unit produces a shell script which can be run in order to emit
?X: an important warning to the user, which will be remembered and shown
?X: at the end of the Configure run as well.
?X:
?X: A typical use would be:
?X:
?X:		./warn <<EOM
?X:		Problem with your C compiler: can't turn debugging on.
?X:		EOM
?X:
?X: or:
?X:
?X:		./warn "Problem with your C compiler: can't turn debugging on."
?X:
?X:	Which will both display to the user:
?X:
?X:		*** WARNING:
?X:		*** Problem with your C compiler: can't turn debugging on.
?X:		***
?X:
?MAKE:Warn: startsh eunicefix
?MAKE:	-pick add $@ %<

: script used to emit important warnings
cat >warn <<EOS
$startsh
?X: Read the whole warning message from stdin into a temporary file
?X: when no argument was supplied.
if test \$# -gt 0; then
	echo "\$@" >msg
else
	cat >msg
fi
?X: Emit the warning, prefixing all lines with '*** '
echo "*** WARNING:" >&4
sed -e 's/^/*** /' <msg >&4
echo "*** " >&4
?X: Save the warning in the logs, which will be shown again at the end
cat msg >>config.msg
echo " " >>config.msg
