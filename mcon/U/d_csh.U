?S:d_csh:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines the CSH symbol, which
?S:	indicates to the C program that the C-shell exists.
?S:.
?S:full_csh:
?S:	This variable contains the full pathname to 'csh', whether or
?S:	not the user has specified 'portability'.  This is only used
?S:	in the compiled C program, and we assume that all systems which
?S:	can share this executable will have the same full pathname to
?S:	'csh.'
?S:.
?C:HAS_CSH:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the C-shell exists.

?C:CSH:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, contains the full pathname of csh.

?X: Previously, I just did $d_csh CSH "$full_csh", but that caused
?X: problems on VMS where the config.sh extraction program changes
?X: $undef to a real cpp undef, and they then had  #undef CSH ""
?X: which the compiler didn't like.  It's easy to work around this,
?X: so I did.  --AD  3/1998.
?X: And we don't want to define CSH if !HAS_CSH, but we don't want
?X: those lines in config.h if they don't need CSH, so protect with ?CSH
?X: and not ?%<. --RAM, 15/02/2004
