?S:src (srcdir):
?S:	This variable holds the (possibly relative) path of the package source.
?S:	It is up to the Makefile to use this variable and set VPATH accordingly

?S:	This variable holds a potentially relative path to the package

?X:
?X: Now check whether we have found the right source tree (i.e. the one for the
?X: package we're about to configure). The original unit from Tom Tromey forced
?X: the user to pick a unique file from his distribution, and we were merely
?X: checking the existence of that file. I prefer to rely on Configure (which
?X: we know *is* present since this unit is part of it!) and look for the
?X: definition of the package variable, making sure it's the same as ours.
?X: If it matches, we know we found the right source tree. -- RAM, 15/03/96

Sorry, I can't seem to locate the source dir for $package.  Please start
Configure with an explicit path -- i.e. /some/path/Configure.
