?S:	This variable contains the value to be passed to the tr(1)
?S:	command to transliterate a newline.  Typical values are
?S:	'\012' and '\n'.  This is needed for EBCDIC systems where
?S:	newline is not necessarily '\012'.
?S:.
?T: DJGPP
: Find the appropriate value for a newline for tr
?X: We can't use $tr since that would cause a circular dependency via Myread
?X: dos djgpp uses '\015\012', but reportedly is happy with '\012' in the
?X: tr command.  I don't know why it passes the '\n' test but later
?X: refuses to work correctly with it.  --AD  6/14/98
