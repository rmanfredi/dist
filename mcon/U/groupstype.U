?S:groupstype:
?S:	This variable defines Groups_t to be something like gid_t, int,
?S:	ushort, or whatever type is used for the second argument to
?S:	getgroups() and setgroups().  Usually, this is the same as
?S:	gidtype (gid_t), but sometimes it isn't.

?C:Groups_t (GROUPSTYPE):
?C:	This symbol holds the type used for the second argument to
?C:	getgroups() and setgroups().  Usually, this is the same as
?C:	gidtype (gid_t) , but sometimes it isn't.
?C:	It can be int, ushort, gid_t, etc...
?C:	It may be necessary to include <sys/types.h> to get any
?C:	typedef'ed information.  This is only required if you have
?C:	getgroups() or setgroups()..
