?X:	What is the type returned by times() ?
?X:
?X: Force inclusion of <sys/types.h>
?X:INC: i_systypes
?MAKE:d_times clocktype: Csym Myread Typedef i_systimes
?MAKE:	-pick add $@ %<
?S:d_times:
?S:	This variable conditionally defines the HAS_TIMES symbol, which indicates
?S:	that the times() routine exists.  The times() routine is normally
?S:	provided on UNIX systems. You may have to include <sys/times.h>.
?S:.
?S:clocktype:
?S:	This variable holds the type returned by times(). It can be long,
?S:	or clock_t on BSD sites (in which case <sys/types.h> should be
?S:	included).
?S:.
?C:HAS_TIMES (TIMES):
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the times() routine exists.
?C:	Note that this became obsolete on some systems (SUNOS), which now
?C: use getrusage(). It may be necessary to include <sys/times.h>.
?C:.
?C:Clock_t (CLOCKTYPE):
?C:	This symbol holds the type returned by times(). It can be long,
?C:	or clock_t on BSD sites (in which case <sys/types.h> should be
?C:	included).
?C:.
