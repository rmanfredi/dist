: static assertion checking include file
?X:
?X: C programs can include this file to perform STATIC_ASSERT() checks
?X: which are done at compile-time and cause the compilation to fail when
?X: the expression is false.
?X:
?X: It is sufficient to compile with: $cc -c $ccflags try.c
?X: There is no need to link the file to spot the assertion failure.
