?S:	This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
?S:	gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usually equal to cc, unimpressive, no?
?S:	Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing the
?S:	flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
?S:	the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be 'workshop'.

Any previous setting of the C compiler flags has been lost.
It may be necessary to pass -Dcc=gcc to Configure right away.

You need to find a working C compiler.
Either (purchase and) install the C compiler supplied by your OS vendor,
or for a free C compiler try http://gcc.gnu.org/
I cannot continue any further, aborting.
